# Progressive Web Apps: A Self-Study Guide

This is a project to create a self-study guide for learning Progressive Web Apps from concepts to code, and design patterns to real-world adoption. It is meant to be beginner-friendly but assumes you have some basic familiarity with web development (HTML/JS/CSS).

Follow the [blog](https://nitya.github.io/pwa) for updates.
