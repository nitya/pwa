## Progressive Web Apps

Wikipedia [defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application) Progressive Web Apps (PWA) as:

> _a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices._

My goal with this project is to explore the world of progressive web apps from concepts to code, from design patterns to real-world adoption. I'm starting with this simple learning roadmap - and exploring related industry and community resources for hands-on learning.

## Learning: Roadmap

I've broken the learning journey into six sections, each associated with a handy tag (ðŸ”–) to discover and browse related blog posts. The sections are:

 * ðŸ”– _[Fundamentals](/tags/fundamentals/)_ - core concepts, terms and tools.
 * ðŸ”– _[Capabilities](/tags/capabilities/)_ - web capabilities and Project Fugu.
 * ðŸ”– _[Case Studies](/tags/case-studies/)_ - real-world adoption and best practices
 * ðŸ”– _[PWABuilder](/tags/pwa-builder/)_ - dev starter kit with develop-to-deploy support
 * ðŸ”– _[Lighthouse](/tags/lighthouse/)_ - perf and compliance auditing for PWA
 * ðŸ”– _[Tutorials](/tags/tutorials/)_ - concepts and tools deep-dives, with code
